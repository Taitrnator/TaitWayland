  "objective": "TicketBiscuit recognized a large unserved market for online ticketing: high school sports. The barrier to entry was the complexity of most online ticketing services. While online ticketing is intended to be convenient for users, it creates a lot of hassle for small event organizers, especially in this particular market. We realized this demographic didn’t want to use scanners, for instance. Ultimately, if we could create a product as simple as tearing ticket stubs, we could serve this market. Share and Tear was designed from this idea. The user simply downloads tickets to our app, and literally swipes to “tear” them at the door. The door man confirms the tear. Additionally, the app needed to maintain this minimal functionality offline.",

        "section1": "I conducted contextual observations at a high school football game. I paid particular attention to the gate volunteers tearing tickets. This helped our team confirm an important requirement: maintain the simplicity of ticket stubs.",
        "section2": "We introduced one additional requirement based on these observations: put the power of tearing and validating the ticket into the hands of the customer, not the gatekeeper.",
        "section3" : "I conducted some contextual interviews at this football game also, which would help us flesh out our personas later. Students and parents alike wanted to share tickets. It wasn't obvious until conducting the interviews. If the tickets are digital they can, and should, be shareable.",
        "section4": "Personas were made for athletic directors, coaches, parents, students, and, gate volunteers. The Share and Tear product focused on the latter three, as athletic directors and coaches have similar needs to the clients we were already serving in other markets. Students and parents wanted a share feature. Ticket volunteers wanted an ticket stack that was easy to read and sort through. Putting the power of tearing tickets in the user hands could satisfy all three personas as it would speed up the process of getting into the event."
