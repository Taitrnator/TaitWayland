Hey guys, this is the codez for my portfolio site. It's a static site, but
I do want it scalable for any future content I add, and I prettymuch hate any CMS
I've used, so Im making it a barebones dynamic app.

It runs a few lines of node, has a few packages. Its a work in progress. Depends on
Angular 1. Uses SASS for the styles. Uses a few other scripts that don't install with NPM,
but they are sort of local to my branding of the site. Right now minified with codekit but
I'm probably going to use Travis CI to do that in the future. Schema should scale also,
but this boils down to keeping all of the content in JSON and consistently naming it.
